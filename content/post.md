# Decoder for 7-segment display

## 7-segment indicator

The 7-segment display is one of the most popular and simplest displays of Arabic numerals and other symbols. Patented as early as 1910 by [Frank Wood], it is still in demand today.

Since LEDs are most commonly used in such displays, and as we know they have a cathode and anode, consequently the displays themselves are divided into 2 subtypes: common cathode and common anode. The differences are minimal, but sometimes there are cases where there is one higher priority option.

The indicator is a set of LEDs with either anode or cathode merged together, depending on the type. As we can see, it is possible to control each segment individually.
